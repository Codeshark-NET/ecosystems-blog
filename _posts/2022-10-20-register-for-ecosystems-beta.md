_Ecosyste.ms is looking for a small number of researchers, application developers and adjacent professionals to test our services and data releases._

In June this year we began work on Ecosyste.ms, a set of free and open resources for those looking to map the landscape of open source software.

Ecosyste.ms was built to identify, secure and sustain critical open source software but it is for anyone looking to develop applications, services and research that's centred on open source software and its relationships with those who build upon it.

Principally Ecosyste.ms provides a comprehensive, structured, and open dataset about free and open source software, its usage and authorship alongside a set of tools and services to resolve software dependency information quickly, to reason about the usage, creation and potential impact on the ecosystem. Finally, we offer support to those who are looking to work with us.

Over the past six months Andrew (otherwise known as @teabass) has been single-handedly building a library of services, indexing millions of open source packages and the repositories that depend upon them. These services include:

* [Packages](https://packages.ecosyste.ms/?ref=open-collective): query package, version and dependency metadata of many open source software ecosystems and registries.
* [Repos](https://repos.ecosyste.ms/?ref=open-collective): query repository metadata for many open source software ecosystems.
* [Resolve](https://resolve.ecosyste.ms/?ref=open-collective): resolve dependency trees of packages for many open source software ecosystems.
* [Parser](https://parser.ecosyste.ms/?ref=open-collective): parsing dependency metadata from many open source software ecosystems manifest files.
* [Licenses](https://licenses.ecosyste.ms/?ref=open-collective): parse license metadata from many open source software ecosystems.
* [Diff](https://diff.ecosyste.ms/?ref=open-collective) & [Digest](https://digest.ecosyste.ms/?ref=open-collective): generate diffs and digests between package releases for many open source software ecosystems.
* [Timeline](https://timeline.ecosyste.ms/?ref=open-collective): providing the timeline of over 4 Billion events for every public repo on GitHub.

Ecosyste.ms gathers data from 26 package managers (more to be added soon)  and indexes repositories from GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket. We continue to actively develop and expand these services (we're adding vulnerability and contribution data soon) but we need you!

### Help us
We're looking for a small number of researchers, application developers and adjacent professionals to ensure that our services are well-presented, documented and practical for a variety of uses.

If you're researching the impact of open source software, building an application, service or business that is dependent on a good understanding of open source software or you're working in government or a non-profit organisation looking to progress policy we'd love to hear from you.
